<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a master candidate for Electrical Science and Technology at the Department of Micro/Nano Electronics (微纳电子学系), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, and under the supervision of Professor [Guanghui He](https://dmne.sjtu.edu.cn/dmne/faculty/heguanghui/). 

My current research interests are at the intersection of computer vision, digital circuits and systems. The current focus is efficient ASIC design for AI applications like transformer accelerating.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
