<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a Ph.D candidate for Electrical Science and Technology at the Department of Micro/Nano Electronics (微纳电子学系), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, and under the supervision of Professor [Guanghui He](https://dmne.sjtu.edu.cn/dmne/faculty/heguanghui/). 

My current research interests are at the intersection of autonomous driving system, digital circuits and systems. The current focus is efficient ASIC design for AI applications like BEV perception, point cloud processing and massive MIMO wireless detector, and emerging computing paradigm design like stochastic computing (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K1JGQBIAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
